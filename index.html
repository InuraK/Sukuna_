      <p><strong>A Midnight Encounter</strong></p>
      <p>
        It started with a question<br>
        in a quiet, glowing night—<br>
        a game, a stranger,<br>
        a simple ask for help,<br>
        and fate whispered,<br>
        “Watch this.”
      </p>

      <p>
        From strangers to friends,<br>
        then best of the best—<br>
        days blurred into joy,<br>
        laughs stitched into time,<br>
        and suddenly,<br>
        no one stood above you.
      </p>

      <p>
        You made my ordinary days feel seen.<br>
        You made the pixels feel like home.<br>
        And somewhere between<br>
        friendly banter and silent stays,<br>
        you fell for me—<br>
        and I, against the odds,<br>
        fell too.
      </p>

      <p>
        We’ve had our storms,<br>
        the highs and the aches,<br>
        but still, you remain—<br>
        in every moment my heart takes.
      </p>

      <p>
        If there’s one thing I know,<br>
        it’s this:<br>
        you are the kindest chapter<br>
        my heart has ever held.<br>
        And no matter where time leads us,<br>
        you’ll always be<br>
        a chapter I’ll reread in my heart forever.
      </p>
      <div class="end">
        — from the girl who still smiles when she thinks of you.
